- Implement a new function in dtvplayer module to support automatic scan operations.
- This function has to go trough all previously used frequencies (482MHz, 490MHz) and perform scan operation on each of them.
- Pay attention that there must be additional synchronization between end of scanning event for one frequency and starting scan on new frequency.

Use code bellow to extend Comm module functionality:
static const char *optString = "h?";
static const struct option longOpts[] ={
{ "help", no_argument, NULL, 'h' },
{ NULL, no_argument, NULL, 0 }
};
Example of scan command: scan  

Verify that full channel list can be acquired and firmed by using new scan command.
